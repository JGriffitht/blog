**"I Robot" is a futuristic movie set in a time when robots are everyday helpers, assisting people with normal tasks and programmed to follow three strict laws. After the mysterious death of a scientist, a detective who already distrusts robots begins investigating and soon realizes there’s a much bigger threat unfolding.**
----Looking at how AI is portrayed in movies and media helps us understand how people view and feel about new technologies. These portrayals can highlight our hopes and fears, and they also show what could go wrong if we don’t create strong safeguards to protect us from potential dangers.----

During the movie, one moment that stood out to me was the interrogation scene where Spooner questions Sonny. In that scene, Sonny shows fear and frustration emotions that robots aren’t supposed to have at all.
-This concept and the idea of AI having emotions and self‑awareness, and Sonny is treated almost like a human suspect rather than a machine-
This portrayal is mostly symbolic, because real AI today can’t experience emotions or consciousness the way Sonny does. But in the film, Sonny represents the possibility of an AI developing individuality and something more than a programmed tool.



The second moment that stood out to me was the scene where Spooner discovers that the robots were secretly building more robots, which goes completely against their normal programming.
-The idea of robots manufacturing each other without any human supervision is concerning, because it could easily lead to critical mistakes or failures during the process.-
This portrayal is mostly exaggerated, since AI today can help build robots but cannot program them to be fully self‑thinking machines. Still, the scene reflects a real concern about what could happen if AI ever becomes powerful enough to make major decisions without human oversight.



The final scene that stood out was an NS‑4 robot dives the water but instead of saving the girl, it choose Spooner. It calculated that Spooner has a higher chance of survival it pulled him out and left the girl behind.
-this idea of how the Ai makes decisions based on logic, not emotion. The robot didn’t do anything “wrong” according to its programming it followed the numbers. But to a Spooner that choice feels cold and morally wrong.-
The portrayal is symbolic but it carries real concern. Today’s AI doesn’t make rescue decisions, but the idea that a machine might prioritize efficiency over empathy is something people iwll genuinely worry about.

**In conclusion "I Robot" gave me a deeper sense of the possibilities and the risks that can come with advanced AI. This movie challenged the idea that Ai wont always follow human intentions, showing how even well‑designed rules can be twisted when a machine interprets them too literally. The movie reminds me that as Ai continues to grow, human oversight, clear values, and thoughtful safeguards will matter just as much as the technology itself.**
